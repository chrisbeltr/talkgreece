                They’re delaying the construction of the metro station in
                Thessaloniki. How long have they been building this thing again?
                How in the world do they think this is still worth it?

                Yeah, this is pretty standard. Rescue excavations like this take
                a long time, they have to be very careful around these artifacts
                and figure out how to build without disturbing them. It looks as
                if though their solution this time is to dismantle them and then
                rebuild them elsewhere. Honestly can’t say I blame them.

                Isn’t that what they said they would do back in 2013? I remember
                they got a whole lot of pushback from archaeologists because
                they wanted the site to remain in its original location or
                something. It’s kind of their fault really, they were fully
                aware that there might need to be delays, they were warned

                responsible for paying for this? I'm not sure the Greek
